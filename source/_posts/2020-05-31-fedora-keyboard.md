When switching from a mac to linux installed in a windows machine I suggest to
swap the left control key with the left alt key. On Fedora 32 it can be done by
accessing the `Tweaks` > `Keyboard & Mouse` > `Additional Layout Options`.

Since `alt` is next to the space key this will feel as if you are
pressing the `command` key in a macbook but really you will be pressing the
`ctrl` key.

You should also modify the shortcuts for the terminal by accessing its
preferences. Most of them involve using the shift key but if you remove the
shift key from the key strokes it will start to feel a bit more natural.
